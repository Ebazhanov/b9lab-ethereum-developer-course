### 1. When I deploy a contract, its address is:

- [ ]  Random
- [ ]  Calculated from a hash of the bytecode
- [ ]  Calculated from a hash of my address
- [ ]  Calculated from a hash of my address and the transaction nonce

 ### 2. When I deploy a contract, compared to the transaction data, the final contract bytecode is:

 - [ ] Shorter
 - [ ] Identical
 - [ ] Longer

### 3. What benefit do the ABI and Web3 contracts give?

- [ ] They compile Solidity code to the proper bytecode
- [ ] They format transaction data to make Solidity compiled code behave as if it had functions
- [ ] They help us call Solidity functions

### 4. An Ethereum contract executes its code when:

- [ ] a. It is the recipient of a transaction
- [ ] b. Its address is mentioned in a transaction
- [ ] c. It receives a call
- [ ] d. Its address is mentioned in a call
- [ ] e. When its original deployer sends a transaction
- [ ] f. When its original deployer sends a transaction to it

### 5. When deploying a contract in a transaction, what is the recipient of the transaction?

- [ ] The blockchain central registry of contracts
- [ ] The owner of the contract
- [ ] The recipient is absent

### 6. What are the dependencies?

- [ ] Geth <-> RPC <-> Web3
- [ ] RPC <-> Geth <-> Web3
- [ ] RPC <-> Web3 <-> Geth
