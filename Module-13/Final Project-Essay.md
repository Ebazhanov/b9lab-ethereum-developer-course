Solution:

Generally speaking, I would like to underline two aspects of the blockchain. It provides immutability of any data and it removes the middleman making the final cost much lower.Again, it is scalable, confidential and tamper-proof.

Ok, so we have several players on the market.

Regulator/government-this is a big question.
This instance kills the whole idea of decentralization since all it wants is to control the legality of actions and make sure taxes are paid properly. I would like it to be replaced with the logic of the smart contract based on public voting. Every vote will change the state of the blockchain and will lead to the most balanced decision-making process based on the real concerns of the voters in any aspect of the economy, politics, culture, etc.
It will finally replace the inefficient, bureaucratic government we have right now. By doing this, it kills two birds with one stone: people do make the laws, and the laws will be executed by the book (should I say by the contract?).  

Road operator wants to make sure it is a well-established business model: the highway is functioning properly, there are no traffic jams, the fare is taken, safety regulations are enforced.
The successful business model wants to reduce costs. Enabling ETH-based payment system will help to reduce the payment fees, make it accesible and affordable for everyone. Moreover, if other stakeholders (e.g.suppliers ) will accept crypto as well, it will bring the overall cost of operation down.

A toll booth is a unit that collects fare. We can narrow down it`s functionality to collecting payments, sending tickets to non-payers.
Problems: payment processing. That problem was already discussed in the previous paragraph.

Ð¡ars are another unit that gets involved in the process. For simplicity, we will only take the ability to safely operate it on highway and use of scannable devices to pay for the road. Again, it all goes down to reducing the cost and using scannable devices that are interconnected with the smart contracts.

Payments: usually they can be either regulated by the market or the government. In our world, it can be done by the following formula set in the smart contract. Every week has 2 free days, that can be randomly chosen every week.
Problems: how to set the fair price
